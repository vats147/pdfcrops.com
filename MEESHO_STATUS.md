# âœ… Meesho Features Hidden - Ready for Production

## What's Hidden

## Current Behavior

When users select **Meesho**:
- They will see the standard interface (no extra checkboxes)
- Basic label cropping works as before (crops to coordinates: x:0, y:490, w:600, h:600)
- No visual changes to the user experience

## What's Ready for Launch (1 week)

All features are implemented and tested, just commented out:

1. **8 Meesho-specific checkboxes** with full functionality
2. **Advanced PDF cropper** with all options
3. **localStorage persistence** for settings
4. **Custom text input** for label printing
5. **Responsive UI** with beautiful design
